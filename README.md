This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start app

Navigate to the backend directory of the project and run:

### `npm start`

This will begin running the local server on port 3000.

This is used to store states for the checkerboard.

Then return to the main directory and in a new terminal run:

### `npm install`

Then run:

### `npm start`

This will begin to run the react app on port 5000.

After that you should be all set!
