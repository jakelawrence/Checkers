This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start app

Navigate to the backend directory of the project and run:

### `npm start`

This will begin running the local server used to store states for the checkerboard.

Then return to the main directory and on a new terminal run:

### `npm start`

This will begin to run the react app on port 5000

After that you should be all set!
